## Contributions

The Kwenta Options Interface is open source, permissionless software that can be developed and hosted by anyone. Thanks in advance for your contributions! Contributors should fork this repository and submit pull requests against the `kwenta/lyra-interface:dev` branch.

The `master` branch will be regularly synchronized in line with changes incoming from the `lyra-finance/interface:master` branch by the devDAO PM. 

Once changes in the `dev` branch have been thoroughly tested and approved, new releases to the Kwenta-hosted Lyra frontend will be pushed to the `deploy` branch.
